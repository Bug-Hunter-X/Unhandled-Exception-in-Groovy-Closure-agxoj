This repository demonstrates a common error in Groovy involving unhandled exceptions within closures. The `bug.groovy` file shows a scenario where an exception thrown inside a closure isn't caught by the calling method. The `bugSolution.groovy` file presents the corrected code that gracefully handles the exception.
